Python Data Types:
    Data Types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
    It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. 
    Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables 
    are instances (objects) of these classes. 

    The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:
    Numeric -> int, float, complex
    Sequence Type -> string, list, tuple
    Mapping Type -> dict
    Boolean -> bool
    Set Type -> set, frozenset
    Binary Types -> bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# For Example:

x = 50  # integer
x = 50.5 # float
x = "Nishan Limbu"  # string
x = ["AI", "ML", "Deep Learning", "Data Structure & Algorithm"] # list
x = ("AI", "ML", 'DL', 'DSA')   # set
