Boolean Data Type:
    Python Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. 
    Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false).
    However non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in a Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. 
    It is denoted by the class bool.

# For Example:
print(type(True))   # output: <class 'bool'>
print(type(False))  # output: <class 'bool'>
