Modules in Python:
    In Python, a module is a file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. 
    Modules help organize and reuse code effectively across multiple projects.

Types of Modules:
1. Built-in Modules: Pre-installed modules that come with Python. Examples: math, os, sys, random, etc.

2. Custom Modules: User-defined modules created to organize custom code. Example: A file named my_module.py containing your functions.

3. Third-Party Modules: Modules installed from external sources (e.g., pip). Examples: numpy, pandas, flask, etc.
