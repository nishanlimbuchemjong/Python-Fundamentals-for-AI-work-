"""
Python Functions:
    It a block of statements that return the specific task. 
    The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs,
    we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

Python Function Declaration:
    Syntax:
        def function_name(parameters):
            statement(s)
            return expression

Types of Functions in Python:
1. Built-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use.
2. User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

# Creating funcitons:
def greeting():
    print("Hello, I am Nishan Limbu")

# calling sum() funciton
greeting()  # output: Hello, I am Nishan Limbu
